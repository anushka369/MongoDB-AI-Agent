# MongoDB GenAI Developer Day

Learnt the foundational/core concepts behind AI agents, like: reasoning, tools, and memory. Covered different agent architectures and built a hands-on MongoDB learning agent using Jupyter Notebook templates with pseudocode. Found out how to build production-grade agentic applications using MongoDB. Developed controllable, reliable agentic workflows with LangGraph.

This repository is home to all the Jupyter Notebooks required for MongoDB's GenAI Developer Day. The self-paced versions of the Developer Days workshops are linked below:
